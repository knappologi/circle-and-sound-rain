# circle-and-sound-rain
Inspired by patatap.com, a rain of circles which plays sound based on key press event.
Based on the patatap assignment in Colt Steeles web development bootcamp course. 

Made using the libraries [PaperJs](http://paperjs.org), for the animations and [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) to play the sounds.

## Circle rain

Press any letter key (a-รถ) to play a sound. During key press, one of the circles will expand in size :)

## Circles (simplified patatap clone)

Press any letter key (a-z) to play a sound. Each key will spawn a circle randomly placed in the window, that shrinks until its invisible.


### Sound sources
Majority of the sound files used in this project are from jonobr1s [Neural-Synchrony project](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony).

I've also added a few sound files found on Freesound.org, by the users [wertstahl](https://freesound.org/people/wertstahl/), [seidhepriest](https://freesound.org/people/Seidhepriest/), [ls](https://freesound.org/people/LS/), [NenadSimic](https://freesound.org/people/NenadSimic/), [soneproject](https://freesound.org/people/soneproject/) and [mad-monkey](https://freesound.org/people/mad-monkey/).
